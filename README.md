# Manual Testing Exploration
A hands-on investigation where I manually tested popular websites and apps to find bugs and usability issues. Each one was evaluated within a strict 2 hour timebox. Each session focussed on uncovering both critical and trivial bugs of the product, and each bug was reported on the Trello board linked here:

## How It Was Done
Here's how the project was done:
### Scope
A range of well-known platforms, from social media, to video games, to maps, to food delivery, etc. were the targets of this project. Well-known platforms were the target because it shows that even industry-leading products have flaws. This highlights how crucial rigorous QA is, especially in an era where many companies have deprioritised thorough testing.

### Bug Reporting
Bugs were reported using the following structure:
* **Description**
    * *Brief summary of the bug.*
* **Preconditions**
    * *Required setup before reproducing the bug.*
* **Steps to Reproduce**
    * *Exact sequence of actions to trigger the bug.*
* **Expected Result**
    * *What should happen in the absence of the bug.*
* **Actual Result**
    * *What actually happens.*
* **Environment**
    * *The environment used to reproduce the bug.*
* **Evidence**
    * *A video/screenshot showing how to reproduce the bug.*

## Key Learning Points
* **No app is truly bug-free**
    * *Even industry-leading platforms have glaring issues under focussed scrutiny.*
* **Time constraints force prioritisation**
    * *You naturally tend to focus more intently on higher-impact areas when under time constraints.*
* **Human intuition can be more important than automation** 
    * *Human eyes and logic can find bugs that computers never could.*
* **Documentation and recording can be longer than finding bugs, but is just as critical. Reproducability is crucial**
    * *Isolating exact steps to trigger bugs can be difficult, but is just as important, so that the devs can understand the issue and can fix it. Ensures developers can reliably reproduce and fix issues, even if it takes more time than the initial finding.*# manual-testing-exploration
